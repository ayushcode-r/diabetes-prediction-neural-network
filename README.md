# Diabetes Prediction using Neural Network 🧠

This project uses a basic neural network model built with Python to predict diabetes based on patient data. It is aimed at beginners and includes clear steps from data loading to model evaluation.

## 📌 Features
- Uses a neural network for binary classification
- Based on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset
- Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow or Keras (if used)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Output
The model predicts whether a patient is diabetic (`1`) or non-diabetic (`0`) based on features like glucose level, BMI, and age.

## 🧑‍🎓 Author
