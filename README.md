# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using two different machine learning approaches:

1. **Random Forest Classifier** (Achieved 100% Accuracy)
2. **Neural Network (Deep Learning)** (Achieved 87% Accuracy)

Both models were trained and tested using the same dataset.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks one by one:
   - First, `USING_RANDOM_FOREST_Accuracy-100%.ipynb`
   - Then, `USING_NEURAL_NETWORK_87.ipynb`
3. Execute all cells in the notebooks to train and evaluate the models.
4. The dataset `diabetes_dataset.csv` must be in the same directory as the notebooks.
